          <p>Kamikaze Legacy, a 21-year-old university student majoring in sound engineering, has 8 years of experience in music-making. During those 8 years, he tinkered with music to not just learn what goes into it, but to make that craft his own. He uses not just the most widely understood instruments, but also the fresh sounds of the often unheard instruments from different cultures. Both sounds, new and old, can be found within his pieces. He prides himself on using them in a new distinct way, entirely unique to his projects and style. His sound is used to exemplify his rich storytelling within his music. The composer is versatile, working well within many different genres and styles, and enjoying the challenge that comes along with different sounds.
